# Gesture-Based Computer Interaction Application

## Overview

This Python application leverages computer vision techniques to enable gesture-based control for various tasks, promoting a more intuitive and ergonomic interaction with your computer. It recognizes hand gestures using your laptop's camera or an external one, allowing you to perform actions such as closing, minimizing and maximizing windows, splitting windows, changing applications, switching between tabs, and selecting items.

## Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to reduce fatigue associated with prolonged mouse or touchpad usage, potentially preventing musculoskeletal issues. By harnessing intuitive hand gestures, the application aims to enhance productivity and provide a worldwide-impact solution for computer interaction.

## Key Benefits

- Fatigue reduction through gesture-based control.
- Worldwide impact on ergonomic computer interaction.
- Increased productivity with intuitive gestures.
- Potential for a groundbreaking invention.

## Features

- Close, Minimize and maximize windows.
- Split windows (Tile window to the left and Tile window to the right).
- Change between applications.
- Change between tabs.
- Select items.

## Development Timeline

The project will follow an Agile methodology, utilizing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. Development phases include:

1. **Research and Planning**
   - Define gestures for each action.
   - Explore existing solutions and identify unique features.

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Install necessary libraries and dependencies.

3. **Data Collection and Training**
   - Capture hand gesture data for training the model.

4. **User Testing and Feedback**
   - Iterate based on user testing to improve accuracy.

5. **Real-time Gesture Recognition**
   - Implement real-time gesture recognition.

6. **User Interface Design**
   - Create an intuitive UI for user customization.

7. **Integration with the Operating System**
   - Implement system-level actions.

8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Conduct extensive testing using TDD principles.

9. **Documentation**
   - Document code, features, and usage instructions.

10. **Deployment and Distribution**
    - Prepare the application for distribution.
